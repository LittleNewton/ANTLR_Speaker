# Getting started with ANTLR in CSharp

ANTLR is a great tool to quickly create parsers and help you in working with a known language or create your DSL. While the tool itself is written in Java it can also be used to generate parsers in several other languages, for instance Python, C# or Javascript (with more languages supported by newer versions).

If you want to use C# you can integrate ANTLR in your favorite IDE, as long as that IDE is Visual Studio Code or an older version of Visual Studio. You can make it work manually with other setups, but the easiest way is to use Visual Studio Code and the available extension to integrate the generation of the grammar into the your C# project.
